The impact of tax-based rewards and mercenary
punishment on public goods games
====
Punishments and rewards have long been an inseparable topic in public goods
cooperation, but both punishments and rewards will face expensive costs.
So how to better apply rewards and punishments is a focal point in the
evolution of cooperation. It is widely recognized that punishments tend to
be more effective than rewards, but in recent years research has found that
pure rewards based on taxes lead to higher levels of cooperation than pure
punishments based on taxes. This paper examines the effect of the manner
and object of rewards on the public goods game on the basis of taxation.
It is found that rewards are more likely to enhance cooperation when they
are used directly to increase the gains of cooperators than when they are
used to support the survival of a third strategy. And in models that combine
rewards and punishments, the use of rewards to support the survival of the
third strategy may reduce the effect of the original punishment.
